# C-Project
Restaurant Project for advanced c++
This is my groups first project in advanced C++, it takes in a few different vectors and through a main menu it allows the user
to select items from a menu txt file then takes a total the outputs tax and a subtotal then adds it to a nightly total
The nightly total is then used to calculate labor, food cost and overall cost this is then used to see how well the resturant did
on a nightly basis.
